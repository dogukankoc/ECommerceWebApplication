This ECommerce Web Application is my first Web API project. I chose ASP.NET Core Architecture in this project and I applied SOLID principles.

I used Onion Architecture for backend and Angular Framework for client.

I used PostgreSQL RDBMS for Database and Entity Framework Core Tools for ORM.

The project is under development.
